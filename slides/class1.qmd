## Introduction

- **Time:** Mon and Wed, 3:50 - 5: 10 PM
- **Lecture:** Lucy Stone Hall (LSH-B266), Livingston campus
- All course materials are hosted on its own site: [https://sselp.github.io/sdawr/](https://sselp.github.io/sdawr/)
- Canvas will be used **only** for posting grades.

## Communication

- We will use Google Chat [450:230(SP2026)](https://chat.google.com/room/AAQANhTZypY?cls=7) for all course-related communication.
    - Course announcements
    - Deadline reminders
    - Course readings, exercises and quizzes (these count toward participation!)
    - Asking questions and **helping each other**!
    - Direct messages for private conversations
    
## Need help?

- **Google chat**: 
    - Arafat and I will do our best to respond to messages daily.
    - You are strongly encouraged to help and support each other.
- **Office hours**:
    - Lei Song: Mon and Wed, 2:50 - 3:50PM (or by appointment)
    - Md Arafat Hassan (Your TA): TBD

## Course Overview

- **By the end of this class, you should**
    - Be comfortable in working with R, including most common spatial functions
    - Have a good sense of where R is headed as a language
    - Know how to seek help properly when don't know how to do something
    - Be using R as part of a ___reproducible___ workflow

## What is a reproducible workflow?

```{r}
#| out.width: 80%
#| echo: false
#| fig.align: center
knitr::include_graphics("figures/class1_reproducibility.png")
```

## Reproducibility

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width = "49.5%"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.show: hold
#| out.width: "100%"
#| fig.align: center

knitr::include_graphics("figures/class1_example1.png")
```

:::

::: {.column width = "50.5%"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.show: hold
#| out.width: "100%"
#| fig.align: center

knitr::include_graphics("figures/class1_example2.png")
```

## Class Overview

- **Course approach**
    - (Largely) flipped model and emphasis on problem solving
        - Programming should be fun! (or at least intriguing)

- **Basic policies**
  - Attendance and communication
  - Attention to detail
  
## Course Requirements

What you need to do:

```{r}
#| echo: false
mat <- rbind(c("Practical assignments (n = 5)", "40%"), 
             c("Participation", "10%"),
             c("Overview for final project", "10%"),
             c("Oral defense for final project", "10%"),
             c("Final project", "30%"))
colnames(mat) <- c("Component", "Grade")
knitr::kable(mat)                 
```

## Practical Assignments

**There will be a quiz-based grade refinement for all assignments.** Each assignment is followed by an in-class, closed-book quiz consisting of **10 questions** directly related to the programming tasks you just completed. Your final score for the assignment will be refined by your quiz performance according to the following tiers:

```{r}
#| echo: false
mat <- rbind(c("8-10", "100%"), 
             c("6-7", "85%"), 
             c("4-5", "70%"), 
             c("0-3", "60%"), 
             c("Miss", "0%"))
DF <- as.data.frame(mat, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
colnames(DF) <- c("Quiz Score", "Assignment credit")
knitr::kable(DF, format = "html", align = "c")
```

## Final Project

- Project overview (10%)
- Project oral defense (10%)
- Final project (30%)
    - Presentation
    - Final report
- Check details on the page of [projects](https://sselp.github.io/sdawr/projects.html)

## More Details

- Check our course [Syllabus](https://sselp.github.io/sdawr/syllabus.html)
- Grading will be based on the rubrics found under the [Assessment](https://sselp.github.io/sdawr/assessment.html)

## Let's Get Set Up!

- [Software installation](https://sselp.github.io/sdawr/software-installation.html)
- **Very important!** Install everything this week. If you run into any issues, don’t hesitate to ask for help.

## Homework

- Go to our [course site](https://sselp.github.io/sdawr/) to check everything.
- Read [Unit1-Module 1](https://sselp.github.io/sdawr/unit1-module1.html) before *section 3.2.1*, *section 1.7 Style* in [Syllabus](https://sselp.github.io/sdawr/syllabus.html), and cheatsheet of RStudio and R markdown on the page of [Cheatsheets](https://sselp.github.io/sdawr/cheatsheets.html).
