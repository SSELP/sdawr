## Class Overview

- By the end of this class, you should:
    - Be comfortable in working with R, including most common geospatial functions
    - Have a good sense of where R is headed as a language
    - Know where to look when don't know how to do something
    - Be using R as part of a ___reproducible___ workflow

- Course approach
    - (Largely) flipped model and emphasis on problem solving
        - Programming should be fun! (or at least intriguing)
    - Lab and office hours as help sessions
